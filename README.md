## About

**On this website I'm showing how passionate I am about coding, learning new technologies and animation in general, I tried my best to go above and beyond the requirements, and learned SASS in two days and how to modularize JavaScript code to improve performance and loading times. I believe this is a really well made project for a beginner, since it's my first project I have special love for this one.**
